# Employee Payroll Tracker Starter Code

This week's Challenge required me to modify starter code to create an application that allows a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. It's asked of me to implement my own JavaScript code to make the application fully functional. 

# Acceptence Criteria
GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data
